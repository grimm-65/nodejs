We use require to call some other file and we pass different things from that file using module

	We have 2 files app.js and stock.js
	create a function in stock.js and then make it available to other ... using
	(Will make this () available to everybody who requires it)

	module.exports = stock;

	in app.js simply
	
	const stock = require('./stock');

now we can call function in stock.js from app.js
